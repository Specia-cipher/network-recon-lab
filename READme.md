# üõ∞Ô∏è Network Reconnaissance Lab

This project simulates a small networked environment for practicing **network reconnaissance**, a foundational phase in penetration testing. It was built to strengthen my understanding of enumeration techniques using tools like **Nmap**, and to prepare for real-world scenarios like **internal network assessments** and **bug bounty engagements**.

# Dionaea Honeypot Setup & Initial Troubleshooting Log

This document chronicles the installation and initial configuration challenges encountered while setting up the Dionaea honeypot, including solutions and current status.

## Project Goal

The primary goal is to successfully deploy and configure Dionaea to emulate various services (SSH, HTTP, Telnet, SMB, etc.) on a dedicated VM, log attack attempts, and store captured malware/interactions for analysis.

## Environment

* **Operating System:** Ubuntu Desktop (likely 20.04 LTS or similar) running in VirtualBox.
* **Dionaea Version:** (Specify if known, otherwise assume latest from source build)
* **VM IP Address:** 10.0.2.15 (This is the target IP for external interactions)

## Installation Summary

Dionaea was installed from source, likely following standard build instructions (e.g., installing dependencies, compiling, `make install`). The installation path is `/opt/dionaea`.

## Initial Configuration & Challenges Faced

### 1. `sqlite3` Database Issues ("Killed" Process)

* **Symptom:** When attempting to interact with the `dionaea.sqlite` database using `sudo sqlite3 dionaea.sqlite`, the process would be "Killed" unexpectedly.
* **Diagnosis (Hypothesis):** This behavior is often indicative of the system running out of memory (OOM Killer) when the `sqlite3` process tries to load the database, especially if the VM has limited RAM.
* **Resolution:** (Mention if you increased VM RAM, or if it was a transient issue you worked around.)
* **Status:** Workaround found / resolved for now, allowing database interaction.

### 2. `emu` Module Preventing Dionaea Startup

* **Symptom:** Dionaea would fail to start or crash immediately, with log messages pointing to issues with the `emu` module or `filter_emu`.
* **Diagnosis:** The `emu` (emulation) module can sometimes be problematic or have dependencies not fully met in certain environments.
* **Resolution:**
    * Edited `/opt/dionaea/etc/dionaea/dionaea.cfg`.
    * Commented out `emu` from the `modules` line in the `[dionaea]` section.
    * Commented out `filter_emu` from the `processors` line.
* **Status:** Dionaea could then start, but other issues persisted.

### 3. "Connection Refused" for Key Honeypot Services (SSH, HTTP, Telnet, SMB)

* **Symptom:** When attempting to connect to the Dionaea VM's IP (10.0.2.15) on standard honeypot ports (e.g., `ssh 10.0.2.15`, `curl http://10.0.2.15`, `telnet 10.0.2.15 23`), the connection was immediately refused.
* **Initial Checks:**
    * Confirmed Dionaea process was running (`ps aux | grep -i dionaea`).
    * Checked network connectivity (VM IP was correct).
* **Key Diagnostic Tool:** `sudo ss -tuln` (checked active listening ports).
* **Critical Finding:** The `ss -tuln` output revealed that Dionaea was **NOT** listening on TCP ports 22 (SSH), 23 (Telnet), 80 (HTTP), or 445 (SMB). It *was* listening on:
    * **TCP:** 27017 (MongoDB - likely for internal logging)
    * **UDP:** 53 (DNS), 69 (TFTP), 111 (RPC), 123 (NTP), 1900 (SSDP), 5060 (SIP)
    * This confirmed that while Dionaea was running, it was not successfully binding to the intended honeypot TCP ports.
* **Attempted Solution (Latest):**
    * Edited `/opt/dionaea/etc/dionaea/dionaea.cfg` again.
    * Modified the `[listen]` section to explicitly bind to the VM's IP:
        ```ini
        [listen]
        # ... other comments ...
        # listen.mode=getifaddrs  <-- COMMENTED OUT
        listen.mode=manual       <-- SET TO MANUAL
        listen.addresses=["10.0.2.15"] # <-- UNCOMMENTED AND SET TO VM IP
        # ... rest of section ...
        ```
* **Current Status of this issue:** The configuration change has been applied.

### 4. Dionaea Silent Startup After Latest Config Change

* **Symptom:** After applying the `listen.mode=manual` change and attempting to restart Dionaea, no startup messages or "cleaning internal updates" output appeared on the console. The process seemed to start silently.
* **Diagnosis:** This usually indicates a critical error preventing full initialization, potentially a syntax error in the configuration or a new binding conflict.
* **Current State:** Dionaea process status after this change needs to be verified (`ps aux`) and its log file (`/opt/dionaea/var/log/dionaea/dionaea.log`) needs to be thoroughly checked for any errors or messages. The `ss -tuln` output after a successful (even if silent) startup is also pending.

## Next Steps (When resuming work)

1.  **Diagnose Silent Startup:**
    * Verify if Dionaea is actually running (`sudo ps aux | grep -i dionaea`).
    * Check `/opt/dionaea/var/log/dionaea/dionaea.log` for any error messages or output from the silent startup.
    * If no logs, re-verify `dionaea.cfg` for any syntax errors in the `[listen]` section.
2.  **Verify Port Bindings:** Once Dionaea starts successfully (with output or silent), run `sudo ss -tuln` to confirm that SSH, HTTP, Telnet, and SMB (and other configured services) are now listening on `10.0.2.15`.
3.  **Test Active Services:** Continue interacting with the currently listening services (MongoDB 27017, UDP 53, 69, 111, 123, 1900, 5060) to generate activity and confirm logging into `dionaea.log` and `dionaea.sqlite`


## üöÄ How It Works

1. Docker is used to simulate a mini internal lab with:
   - `vulbapp` ‚Äì a deliberately vulnerable web app
   - `ftp-server` ‚Äì exposes FTP services
   - `smb-server` ‚Äì runs SMB for file sharing
   - `linux-victim` ‚Äì a basic Linux target

2. `recon.py` performs an automated Nmap scan of each container using aggressive detection options:
   ```bash
   nmap -A -T4 target
üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Docker ‚Äì For building and managing isolated lab containers

Nmap ‚Äì The core reconnaissance tool used in the script

Python 3 ‚Äì Automation using subprocess module

BackBox Linux ‚Äì The project environment

üìñ Learning Objectives
Practice network reconnaissance in a safe, offline environment

Automate enumeration using Python

Gain hands-on experience with common network protocols (FTP, SMB, HTTP)

Build habit of documenting findings ‚Äî essential for pentesting and bug bounty reports

‚ö° Getting Started
Run from the host machine after your containers are up:python3 recon.py

All results will be saved inside the scan-results/ folder.

üîç Sample Output Snippet
From vulbapp_nmap.txt:

PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
80/tcp open  http    Apache httpd 2.4.41
|_http-title: VulnApp Login
...
üí° Next Steps
Add more services (e.g., DNS, MySQL) to expand the lab

Integrate vulnerability scanners like Nikto or OpenVAS

Write custom parsers to summarize Nmap results

üìé Related Projects
You can find my Vulnerable Bank App ‚Äî a Dockerized web pentesting lab ‚Äî as a companion project.

## üìÑ Nmap Scan Parsing (New Feature)

To improve readability and reporting, this project now includes a parsing script that automatically extracts key information from raw Nmap scans and generates human-readable summaries.

### üîß How It Works
- The script `parse_nmap.py` reads raw `.txt` output files in the `scan-results/` directory.
- For each scan file (e.g., `vulbapp_nmap.txt`), it creates a corresponding summary file (e.g., `vulbapp_summary.txt`).
- Summaries include:
  - Host and IP information
  - Open ports and associated services
  - Basic version info of detected services
